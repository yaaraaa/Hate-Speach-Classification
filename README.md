# Hate-Speech-Classification

The purpose of this notebook is to build a machine learning pipeline that classifies tweets into hate speech or non-hate speech. It involves loading a labeled dataset, preparing the data through preprocessing, representing text using techniques like TF-IDF or embeddings, and training models such as Logistic Regression or deep learning networks, with evaluation based on the macro F1 score.
